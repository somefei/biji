§Operating systems provide an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users
> programs: 进程
> allocate resources to programs 分配资源给进程
 - Computer system :  hardware,  operating system,  application programs,  user
 - Interrupts
 - Real-Time Embedded Systems

 - [ ] **嵌入式系统**是专门为某一特定功能设计的计算机系统，它通常嵌入在一个更大的设备中，例如  微波炉中的控制系统  汽车中的防抱死制动系统（ABS）
 - [ ] **实时系统**是指必须在规定的时间内完成某些任务的系统。
 - The basic unit of computer storage is the bit, which contain one 0 or 1, and a **byte** is 8 bits; a **kilobyte** or **KB** is 1024 bytes; a **megabyte (MB)** is 1024*1024 bytes; a **gigabyte (GB)** is 1024^3 bytes; a **terabyte (TB)** is 1024^4 bytes.
 - An operating system is software that manages the computer hardware, as well as providing an environment for application programs to run.
## QUIT	
 1. We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use of the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to “waste” resources? Why is such a system not really wasteful?
> Single-user systems should maximize use of the system for the user. A GUI might “waste” CPU cycles, but it optimizes the user’s interaction with the system.
> `GUI虽然比CLI消耗更多资源，但它的价值体现在提升了用户的操作效率和舒适感上。`
> Command-Line  (CLI), Graphics  User  Interface  (GUI)
 2. What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing an operating system for a real-time environment?
 >The main difculty is keeping the operating system within the fixed time constraints of a real-time system. If the system does not complete a task in a certain time frame, it may cause a breakdown of the entire system.
