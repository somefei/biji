<p>there was something you said at the end of the lecture on Tuesday ,  something about there was not really being in a reginal place<br>
there was no such thing as a original plays.Yes that’s the () quote from Charis Mee<br>
You probably be hearing a lot about him, he has becoming a pretty famous <s>play writter</s>playwright<br>
i’m been thinking about this quote, i mean there must be some original plays out there<br>
was over sta thing somewhat, but the theatre dose have a long tradition of browing<br>
let’s take shasbia, like most writte rs restate from other sources on the bashiesn</p>
<p>This is ()() ,in the opening scence of “bridge of spes”<br>
and this is what that () block actually looks like today<br>
this is all relaty Angle’s job,<br>
every single set decorater in NewYork probably used about ten times<br>
to make the scence convincingly look like 1957, every detail in this street has to be changed, right down to the font on the signs.<br>
Rena took us through eclectic encore props in NYC to show how she’d turn a modern a New York city street into a 1950s time capsule.<br>
when a location is scouted , the first order of business is hiding things that don’t belong to the era.<br>
That starts with taking down security cameras and swapping all the cars in the street for vintage ones with period license plates.<br>
And knowing what signs to put up means knowing your history.<br>
They used to pay () in twenty 30s 40s<br>
I would put these in a smoke shop window.<br>
this big () signs in ‘bridge of spies’ probably in(0 in 50s, it’s carently looks high as a building<br>
A lot of neighborhoods were also historically definedly by their communites,  so you need cultural signifiers, like these signs in Hebrew or specific food advertisements.<br>
this raise text means it was probably from the 50s or 60s, while the flat text on these means they were produced a bit later, since most city stopped embossing road signs in the 70s and 80s.<br>
the font is also a give away.<br>
that (spitting) sign looks all because that is the type around 90th century, where this is more popular in the 80s.<br>
Besides font and embossing, the main thing that set decritors look at when deciding what fits into their era is materials.<br>
this means knowing what (signs) were made from in previous decades.<br>
metal<br>
as opposed to the plastics used in more recent decades which made signs lighter<br>
Signs, however can only do so much.<br>
Some contemproray giveaways are literally bolted into the grand, so we will cover thouse using  hollow crates and barrels.<br>
All the telephone (booths) can visually block other motherfuckers.<br>
this one would fit right in on the Mahd street corner for the mid 50s to the late 70s.Manhattan<br>
we now can tell this payphones from the 50s beside on the and steals of the<br>
the plast dials are come later in the 70</p>
<p>（）can also have large giveaways, like mordern traffic lights or street lamps.<br>
strategically placed kiosks can also hide large giveaways<br>
for 50s movie she takes these out of newsstands and filled with magazines,newspapers,signs,and products all the specific signs.<br>
besides getting perious products from pro like this one, set decroradors will sco the basement of local go stores, while shop keepers often keep products from decades ago.<br>
stuff that good for a hadw store, a beauty p<br>
according to Rena, the key to making store looks real  is the quantity of the products.<br>
she’ll sometimes scan this packaging, providing the copy of that and use it to rape rows to rows of empty boxes.<br>
set decoradator also do a lot of research into the consumer culteral vi, espacially for a 50s piece, since consumer g had a lot of information on the decades ()<br>
they need to know what people were buying and selling, and what kind of services were offered on every block.<br>
new  like televisions are also often displayed in windows.<br>
this is perfect for an ecletic town store.<br>
even closing stores have the specific for specific eras.<br>
nowadays we take sound in movie for granted, i mean you still might see black and white movie occasionaly, but you hardly ever see silent movies any more.<br>
It’s interesting to know that the use of record a sound  was originally a controv, some dericters, or some film makers even thought it shouldn’t be used.<br>
for the 50 () that fill the front of () department store and the wideside story, Rena found a vintage man can have, which for female are rounder and has less make up compared to later decades.<br>
the () Bay is in the east of US, it’s hug, the largest restivate in US, and it’s important to local enconermece.<br>
But like many of the world waterways , the A is been polluted, and efforts to stop that from happening have not been entirely sucessful.<br>
And that’s probably because of the type of pollution effecting the A, which means you might prodect.<br>
first let’s mention that the sources of pollution are too genally types<br>
Point source pollution has an identifiable source, and you can find a specific point , where, say one particular pipe is dumping polluctants into the bay.<br>
and treat the water right there with the pollutions coming from.<br>
and that’s what happened over the past 30 years or so.<br>
modifications have been made in factories and swage treatment plants to treat the polluted water before it release into the public waterways.<br>
but there is also something we called non-point source pollutions.<br>
Nowadays, the most serious pollution threat doesn’t come from any particular source, like a factory or sewage treatment plant, but it original from many sources over a large area.<br>
and this non-point source pollution is a challenge to deal with , because it doesn’t just end up base one pipe , you can’t identify percesly where it coming from.<br>
and to be specific, the biggest problem now facing the A bay is due not to toxins, but to nutrients contained in chemical fertilizers on farms all over the rigion.<br>
this nutrients, like phosphorous and especially nitrogen wash away in what we call agricalture runoff.<br>
That’s when water from hard rain or melting snow carry these chemicals down to stream and into the bay, and there they stimulate the explosive growth of algae.<br>
And that uses up much of oxygen in the water, oxygen that fish and other aquatic organisms need to stay alive.<br>
So, since there is no single place you can treat the runoff before we the bay, any efforts to reduce these non-point source pollution generally need to be end keeping pollution out of the stream at the first place.<br>
But before we go into that, let’s look at the role of nitrogen fertilizer in modern farming.<br>
before a great increasing in feriliz<br>
in the past, farmers used natural fertilizers and rotied crops, so in add ition to conmercial food crobise like coner and weat they might plant the like for animal feruel.<br>
But these legumes also enrich the soil, by converting the nitrogen in the atmosphere into nitrates, a form of nitrogen that crops like wheat and corn can use it as a nutrient.<br>
and these and other covered crops, planed to hold the soil after the wheat and corn was harvest , they store much as the surplus nitrogen during the time of the year when the runoff turned up to be greatest.<br>
but farming practise has changed, as farmers came to to use more and more conmical fertilizers in oder to increase rpe-production on the same of the land.<br>
but more is not always better, at least it turns chemical fertilizer in the environment.<br>
and long away, from a switch from legumes to anmial feed more suited to intensive largescale anmimal production,<br>
and the excess nitrogen, once trapped by these cover crops, eigher washed away into the next big rain or went down to the grand water and  either way eventrually ended up into the stram and the bay.<br>
and that’s what we said as more alage in the water, and less oxygen for the fish and other aquatic life to breath.<br>
after the main crops are havested, more farmers are planting cover crops again.<br>
other kinds like () and () that hold the nitrogen and keep it from washing out of the soil during the month when that most likely to occur.<br>
and the second stratge is to plant the at the edge of the steams not crops but natural ereas trees.<br>
the roads of these trees can be observied the natrosirunoff before it reaches the streams.<br>
farmers sometime object to letting trees grow on land they may otherwise be cultiviting crops.<br>
But the government program they compensate them, they pays them for creating this buffer zones between their fields and streams that adventraly feed into the bay like the A.<br>
and it begin to show some success.<br>
The islands are home to mount cated, one of the worlds largest active volcanoes.volcanoes.<br>
capable of spering of tens of millions of meters in in a single eruption, destracted powers is nothing to<br>
But there maybe a way to use the basalt rock inside   to save humanity.<br>
That’s right, blowing up this volcano could offset Earth’s emissions for the forseeable future.<br>
Obviously, destroying and this volcano is not a good idea.<br>
The ecological fallout will be unpredictable.<br>
But even if we harvested some of that basalt, could we really use it to stop climate change?<br>
rock weathering occurs whenever it rains.<br>
As falling rainwater mixes with atmospheric carbon dioxide, it becomes a weak acid that can eat away minerals called silicates.<br>
And since silicates are in over 90 present, it happens pretty much anywhere rain hits stone.<br>
As the acid reacts with stone, these dissolved carbon dioxide in the rainwater turns into a new form called bicarbonate, which tricked down stream alongside the rain to the ocean.<br>
Here marine critters use it to create structures like shells.<br>
And when they die, those shells sinked to the seafloor trapping that carbon dioxide in the ocean for .<br>
This process has a massive impact on Earth climiate.<br>
when it’s warm and wet, the rock weathering speed up, tempering greenhouse warming.<br>
build up atomosphere carbon dioxide.<br>
but these effects take time, natural rack wheathering balances Earth’s climiate over millions of years.<br>
thankfully, exports working to sequester atomspheric des this carbon has planed to speed things up.<br>
two major factors determing the pace of this process, the type of rocks exposed to wheather and the amount of rocks that exposed.<br>
that form at higher temperatures te to wheather faster due to their chemical composition.<br>
these rocks include those from Earth deep mental and vocanic rocks like basalt.<br>
but the mountains, not very much rocks is exposed.<br>
so some climate exports believe we should harvest that fast wheathering rock and piled it out to wheather more rock in last time.<br>
rather than leading to event all new techology, we can rely on existing system for and processing rock.<br>
and since agriculture communities have long known that volcanic rock and soils can improve ()(), farm lands can be the perfect despos sides.<br>
but for these approch it have impact, it needs to be deployed globally.</p>
